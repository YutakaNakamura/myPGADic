WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0 input topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0 input topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0 output topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0 multiplier stage topwithHPS/lcd/datout/BRAM_PORTA_B_addr0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

Please refer to the user guide and if one of the internal P feedback opmodes is possible for this design the PREG attribute must be set to 1, currently set to 0
